# Biomech_neural_network
The EMG neural network code for the University of Sheffield ACS340 Biomechatronic individual project. 

The EMG data can be found here: http://ninapro.hevs.ch/
This project used data from database 1 excercise 2.

To run the second assignment script, the moving average EMG data and the gesturePerformed variables from the first script 
will either need to be saved as emgMAV and gesturePerformed respectively, or lines 10-11 of assignment_script_2.m need to be
commented out.
